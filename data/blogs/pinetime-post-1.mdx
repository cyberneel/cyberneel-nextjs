# How it started
&emsp; Over summer break, I was participating in an event called "Arcade" by Hack Club. This event gave you tickets for time you spent creating open source personal projects, it was AWESOME! I got 450+ tickets and redeemed cool prizes like a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, 10 year domain, a MacBook Air, and of course, a PineTime!

&emsp; I was super excited to get my hands on the PineTime, an open-source smartwatch, as my last smartband (Wyze Band) died a while back.
