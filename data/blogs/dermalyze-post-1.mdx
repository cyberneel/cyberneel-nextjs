# The Idea
&emsp;What if you could simply take a picture of your rash or patch of pimples and get and instant response with what it may actually be along with common treatments? This is what my friends, a couple of CS kids and a Bio kid, and I asked ourselves when we wanted to hop onto the AI hype train and were looking for a project.
# Well, Doesn't That Already Exist?
&emsp;We do realize we are not inventing something out of the ballpark, **YET**. But during our initial research into this topic, the existing apps that we found had a few things about them which we did not like, but the two things we were really focussed on were:

* **Cost:** Most of the premium tools available out there had some sort of cost associated to them in some way, most had either a subscription or an annoying experience filled with adverts.
* **Bias:** The few decent free options we did find for this use case, were usually sponsored by some company and were only showing products for that company.
* **Features:** Overall, they were still missing features such as providing common treatments and data on the skin condition itself.
# Progressâ€¦
## Streamlit Era
&emsp;The first prototype for this project was started on Jan 1, 2024. The prototype used Streamlit, a tool that turns python scripts into web apps, as we our team used it before to throw together a prototype for UNT's hackathon.
