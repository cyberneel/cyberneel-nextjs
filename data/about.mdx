&emsp;Computer Science is filled with amazing tangents into various fields that drive our world. That's why I love CS! My whole CS journey has been focused around project based learning and exploration rather than competitions & exams for prestige. That's where this blog comes in! I am excited to share progress about my projects and exploration to others.

&emsp;You can expect project updates, art posts, random rants, maybe some tutorials, and more! One of my biggest hobbies is making digital renders, and that stemmed from a tangent I took in Computer Graphics. So I love exploring fields through CS and hope to share that mindset with you all!
