I finally made myself a LinkedIn profile earlier this week, and boy does it feel like Facebook for "professionals." All the engagement seemed fake and just made up.

One post I saw was from a high school senior who claims to be an entrepreneur that empowers others. The post immediatly screamed AI and I was right. It was about a young girl saving for a new bike by selling bracelets. Guess what my my browser was telling me?

"AI-generated content detected."

My entire feed was filled with non-sense like this, even from professionals that have established LLCs. One of the posts had emojis every line and was trying to sell professional insurance services.

Anyway, I found LinkedIn to be very strange. On one hand, there were legitimate people sharing their experiences who I met in real life and connected with, but on the other hand, most people seemed to be using AI for attention.

They just looked unprofessional. I always thought LinkedIn was THE place for professionals to connect, but I was let down by the quality.

I made a little post about this on my LinkedIn, check it out below.
