=ReAdMoRe=

## Project Details
- Collaborated with active maintainer of iOS companion app to design a sleep tracking feature that needs programming on both the phone app and watch.
- Learned to work with memory constraints of microcontrollers in C++ and explored low memory implementations of commonly used data structures in programming.
- Explored various algorithms for determining sleep activity based on heart rate and motion, allowing for a better understanding on the design of the app.
